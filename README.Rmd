VeRitas allows for automated feedback on submitted code through a manually designed set of feedback rules. These rules consist of binary tests on the submitted code, based on the outcome of which feedback is shown and after which the code is sent to a next test.

## Installation

You can install the development version of VeRitas with the following command (requires a functioning installation of the devtools package):

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("koenvanbenthem/VeRitas")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example,fig.width=7,fig.height=7,out.width="50%",fig.align='center'}
library(VeRitas)

ref <- list(a=17,
            b=21)

net <- list(start=node("has_val(ref$a)",goT="END",goF="S1",doT="[✓] a is found!",doF="[x] a is not found"),
            S1=node("did_call('plot')",goT="END",goF="END",doT="[?] Why plot? Please find a instead!")
            )
library(igraph)
drawNet(net,draw="static",layout=layout_as_tree,margin=0.3,size=30,vertex.shape="none",vertex.label.color="black")
net <- cleanNet(net)
trackfuns <- extractFuns(net)

runEval("examples/01-simplest/code1.R",trackfuns,ref,net)
```
